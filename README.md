# Quiz_Application
The  Quiz Application is a web-based project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and Java as the backend. It allows users to start a quiz, answer multiple-choice questions, and view their score instantly. The system provides a clean interface, and efficient score evaluation, making it ideal for practice exams and learning. 

🖥️ Frontend (User Interface):
HTML – to structure the quiz pages (welcome screen, questions, result page).
CSS – to style the layout, buttons, colors, and overall UI.
JavaScript – to handle question display, timer, answer selection, score calculation on the client side, and sending/receiving data from the backend.
🛠️ Backend (Server-Side Logic):
Java – to manage question data, validate answers, process scores, and communicate with the frontend.
